##### About me 

I'm just starting my career in frontend development, but I feel very confident in my skills and potential. I pick things up quickly, collaborate effectively in a team environment, and am genuinely interested in my ongoing professional development. I've independently mastered the basics of HTML and CSS and have now begun studying JavaScript. My English proficiency is strong enough for professional tasks and communication, and I actively practice my speaking skills.\
I am a very motivated person and I am sure that I will be useful to work in your team.
